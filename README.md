# BinaryClock
This visual works and is read like the binary clock that was sold by ThinkGeek.
The clock will automatically scale to various sizes that are divisble by 8. Values over 32 are untested, but should work.
Colors are able to be set alongside cube width, and the program will use the local system time.
